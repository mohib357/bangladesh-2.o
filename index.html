                challenges such as inflation, income disparity, and trade imbalances, and explored potential policy
                paths toward a more resilient and forward-looking economy.</p>

                    Hasina’s 15-year rule. Led by the youth, and a non-political platform, the uprising witnessed a
                    moment of unprecedented unity. But the transition period has been fraught, and the interim
                    government is dealing with long reform agenda: <br>re-establishing law and order, stabilising the
                    economy and addressing various human rights abuse. People expect a ‘systemic’ change, which prevents

In this historical moment when Gen Z and reformists are driving Bangladesh, I feel charged and would like to reflect on the call made by Dr Muhammad Yunus for people to come forward and work with him. The Yunus-led interim government along with the student leaders have the task for reform and the establishment of justice cut out for them. So let us take a step in the direction of our action and commitment to materialise this agenda.</p>
